## 🎲 The Tower of Hanoi

The **[Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)** is a **mathematical game** or **puzzle**
consisting of **three towers** and a number of **disks of various diameters**,
the objective of the puzzle is to move the **entire stack** to **another tower**.

> **NOTE:** The **[Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) must obey** the **following rules**
>
> | Rule | Details                                                                                                                                     |

> | 2    | Each move consists of taking the **upper disk** from one of the towers and placing it on top of **another tower** or on an **empty tower**. |
> | 3    | **No disk** may be **placed on top** of a disk that is **smaller** than it.                                                                 |

> ⭐ *The term **`legal move`** used throughout this assignment refers to **disk movements** that **obey the rules** mentioned above*.

This assignment consists only resources from **[Unit 2](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a)** and **[Unit 3](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a)**
of the **[Advanced Placement Computer Science A](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a)** course;
although there might be solutions that come with more experienced features,
you should be able to complete this with **just knowledge from the two units**.

## ✔️ Q1: Check if Disks are Legally Movable

There's a **common misunderstanding** of the effects of games on peoples' **physical and mental health**,
that the majority believe games could lead to a **children's toxicness** and further ~~*commit crimes*~~ insult their parents 👍.
As a result, we the *Association of Friendly Games for Everyone*, aims to **address** the fact that **they're wrong**.
What affects peoples negatively is their **greed of playing unfairly** and **taking advantages** over others;
while games that are **played fairly** would be **100% friendly** to everyone, including new-borns. 🧒

As you could see from the **statistics above**, **unfair games** are **extremely harmful**.
To prevent such thing from happening ever again and ruin our world, we have to **teach everyone** how to **obey rules correctly** in games.
You are the **chosen one** ~~*to be tortured*~~ so please help us get this resolved ASAP (as soon as possible)
by **creating a program** that determines whether peoples are **playing the game correctly**.

> **GOAL:** Determine whether a move between towers is legal, return true for legal movement or false otherwise.
> ```java
> /**
>  * Check whether a disk could be legally moved from a tower to another (Unit 2 & Unit 3)
>  * @param board The Hanoi Tower object
>  * @param disk_from The original (source) tower ID of the disk
>  * @param disk_to The new (destination) tower ID of the disk
>  * @return Whether a disk could be legally moved from a tower to another
>  */
> public static boolean disk_movable(HanoiTower board, int disk_from, int disk_to) {}
> ```
> **TIP:** Check out the definition of the term **`legal move`** mentioned under game rules.

## 👫 Q2: Perform Legal Move between Towers

*(Note: Incomplete Description)*

Nice! Seems like you had resolved the issue of peoples playing games unfairly, yet it sure isn't good enough for us.
While you were away, we observed that the world could be even better by simply avoid having miscommunications.
After an in-deep discussion with the professionals in our association,
we proudly concluded that the best solution is to simplify our use of language.

Rather then mentioning "move the disk from tower A to tower B",
we could instead say "A & B" to perform a legal disk move between the towers.
Since you had helped us before we truly believe in you,
please help us make a program to perform the task.

> **GOAL:** Perform a **legal move** between the towers with IDs of **`tower_a`** and **`tower_b`**.
> ```java
>  /**
>   * Legally moves a disk between two towers (Unit 2 & Unit 3)
>   * @param board The Hanoi Tower object
>   * @param tower_a The first tower, could be either the source or destination of the disk
>   * @param tower_b The second tower, could be either the source or destination of the disk
>   */
>  public static void disk_movement_legal(HanoiTower board, int tower_a, int tower_b) {}
> ```
> **TIP:** There's maximum one solution considered as a **legal move**,
> which is either moving the **smaller disk** above the **greater disk**
> or transferring the **disk** to another **tower without a disk**.
